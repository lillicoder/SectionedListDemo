Sectioned ListView Demo

Demonstration of creating a sectioned list. This demo avoid using tricks like nested ListAdapters and provides an example
of a list backed by a standard BaseAdapter and a list backed by a standard BaseExpandableListAdapter. Both adapters make
use of data structures that support 1 level deep relationships.
